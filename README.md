The code in this repository was written for a final project in AE138 - Vector 
Based Dynamics at San Jose State University.

The project aimed to enhance understanding of how to set up and conduct 
analyses of the motion of particles and systems of particles. Each project 
was approved by the instructor before beginning. 

The variation of the project that was conducted aimed to model a Disney 
teacup style ride. The ride was accelerated at a constant rate, and the time 
that it took for the rider to reach an acceleration high enough to cause 
blackout was noted.
